# The data


```{r}
load("~/GitHub/IL_CBS_social_survey/.RData")
#lss_comb <- read_csv("~/GitHub/IL_CBS_social_survey/data/lss_comb.csv")
```


Main dataset - `lss_comb`: CBS/lamas social surveys (5 surveys 2015-2020, total population of 43,628). Participants are citizens selected for survey by Lamas. Surveys conducted face to face in homes.

```{r}
lss_comb %>%
